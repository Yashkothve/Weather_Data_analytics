# Weather Data analytics

Here, The Weather Dataset is a time-series data set with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location. It records, Temperature,Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, and Conditions.

Basic Information:

You imported the Pandas library and loaded the dataset using pd.read_csv.
You displayed the first few rows of the dataset using .head().
Dataframe Exploration:

You used .shape to get the number of rows and columns.
You accessed the index using .index.
You accessed column names using .columns.
You checked data types using .dtypes.
Unique Values and Counts:

You found unique values in the 'Weather' column using .unique().
You found the number of unique values in 'Weather' using .nunique() and .count().
You used .value_counts() to count occurrences of each unique value.
Data Filtering:

You filtered data to find instances when the 'Weather' is 'Clear' using boolean indexing.
You used .groupby() and .get_group() to retrieve specific weather conditions.
Null Values:

You identified null values using .isnull().sum() and checked non-null values with .notnull().sum().
Renaming Columns:

You renamed the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' using .rename().
Statistical Measures:

You calculated the mean, standard deviation, and variance of various columns using .describe(), .mean(), .std(), and .var().
Complex Queries:

You performed complex queries using boolean conditions involving multiple columns.
Summary for GitHub:
Here is a concise summary that you can use for GitHub:
