# Weather Data analytics

Here, The Weather Dataset is a time-series data set with per-hour information about the weather conditions at a particular location. It records, Temperature,Dew Point Temperature, Relative Humidity, Wind Speed, Visibility, Pressure, and Conditions.


**Summary:**

The analysis of the weather dataset provides valuable insights into various aspects of weather conditions at a specific location. Key findings include the distribution of wind speed, occurrences of specific weather conditions like "Clear" and "Snow," statistical measures of different weather parameters, and complex conditions involving multiple factors.

This analysis showcases the power of Pandas DataFrame in exploring, filtering, and summarizing data. It enables us to extract meaningful information and trends from the dataset, aiding in better understanding weather patterns and conditions.

These insights can be further used for decision-making, trend analysis, and forecasting in various fields that rely on weather data, such as transportation, agriculture, and urban planning.

If you plan to use this analysis for a GitHub repository, you can organize the code snippets, insights, and conclusions into a Jupyter Notebook or markdown file. This would make it easy for others to follow the analysis and understand the findings. Additionally, you can include visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, or line charts to enhance the presentation of your analysis.



**Basic Information:**

You imported the Pandas library and loaded the dataset using **pd.read_csv**.
You displayed the first few rows of the dataset using **.head().**
Dataframe Exploration:

You used **.shape** to get the number of rows and columns.
You accessed the index using **.index**.
You accessed column names using **.columns**.
You checked data types using **.dtypes**.

**Unique Values and Counts:**
You found unique values in the 'Weather' column using **.unique()**.
You found the number of unique values in 'Weather' using **.nunique()** and **.count()**.
You used **.value_counts()** to count occurrences of each unique value.

**Data Filtering:**
You filtered data to find instances when the 'Weather' is 'Clear' using boolean indexing.
You used **.groupby()** and **.get_group()** to retrieve specific weather conditions.

**Null Values:**
You identified null values using **.isnull()**.**sum()** and checked non-null values with **.notnull().sum()**.

**Renaming Columns:
**You renamed the 'Weather' column to 'Weather Condition' using **.rename()**.

**Statistical Measures:
**You calculated the mean, standard deviation, and variance of various columns using **.describe()**, **.mean()**, **.std()**, and **.var()**.
